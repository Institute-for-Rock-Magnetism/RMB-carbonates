# RMB-carbonates

The Rock Magnetic Bestiary (RMB) is a curated collection of rock magnetic data developed at the Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) focused on well-characterized synthetic and natural materials. Inspired by medieval bestiaries that cataloged natural entities through allegorical descriptions, the Rock Magnetic Bestiary aims facilitate the interpretation of the magnetic properties of natural samples by comparison with detailed reference datasets.

This repository contains data from the carbonate portion of the Rock Magnetic Bestiary (RMB Minerals â€” RMB carbonates). It is focused on low-temperature remanence data from siderite. See more information at: https://pmagpy.github.io/RockmagPy-notebooks/book/minerals/siderite.html.
